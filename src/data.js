It was fairly cold and windy at night, but the wind died down during the day and the cool air made it the perfect temperature for riding.  I couldn’t even tell you how many miles we rode in just two days here.  Definitely looking for an excuse to get back to this area.  This trip was also a sad one as it marked the last adventure with Mark until I can get back out west."

I was looking at the trip between the Colorado River and Sedona, AZ and was pretty disappointed.  Without much time, I wanted something quick and epic.  After staring at a map a while, Hualapai Peak jumped out.  Turns out, the area was closed for the winter, but that sign really just looked like it applied to cars… so off I went.  I started the steep, vacant, snow-packed climb to the peak, but with only a few hours, about 8 miles, and several thousand feet to climb in the snow, I ended up going to a different peak (unmarked on Google Maps) named Aspen Peak.  Total trip about 5 miles, 1,500 feet of elevation gain, and a fast jog to the bottom to make some time.  While I may not have reached the summit I wanted, it hit the goal of quick and epic."

I spotted a road that paralleled the Colorado River on the CA/AZ border and decided to follow it.  I just wanted to get to the northern interstate route, but I figured I’d stop to see the river since it was there.  Most stops were anti-climatic with houses blocking the path to the river.  Then I spotted this unmarked spot on the map and decided to check it out.  There was a small loop at the end of a gravel road with a fire ring in the center and no one around for miles.  I decided to stop for the night.  It was worth it.  I spotted an owl, a bobcat, several ducks flying on the river, fish jumping, some weird white birds flying up and down the river, the moon reflecting off the water, and a great sunset.  Plus, there was a great swimming hole to clean up – even though it was freezing."

This is one of those climbing meccas we’ve been wanting to explore.  There were several friends heading up from our climbing gym, so we decided to go as well.  We stayed cheap and comfortable at the Pleasant Valley Pit Campground, allowing maximum time for bouldering.  We learned our hands were not quite ready for this much bouldering outdoors, but with only a few days we pushed through a little surface pain.  Still want to get back out there and send Ketron Classic (V4)."

Some of the pictures in the slide deck are from the south side of the lake during a climbing/biking trip in June and the others are from a climbing trip to the north side of the lake in Holcombe Valley.  While I only got to go once, Holcombe Valley hits the top five of my favorite places; the site was so remote, and you could stay for weeks and not even touch the surface of all the bouldering.  Jayden, Elliott, and Stephanie joined us on the June trip when Mark and I introduced Elliott to mountain biking.  The town of Big Bear is much too busy for my liking, but the surrounding mountains are spectacular."

Less than two hours from Camp Pendleton, I could make day trips if I wanted, but there was no need with such great camping.  Most nights were spent at Humber Park.  With Lily Rock and Suicide Rock as backdrops, you could sit below in awe of the sheer rock faces.  There was bouldering around every corner, and that doesn’t even touch the iconic routes on Tahquitz.  While not an established trail, my favorite was the climber’s descent trail that (with a bit of route-finding and scrambling) led to Lily Rock.  Once thoroughly exhausted, you could head down to the quaint mountain town for some ice cream or coffee. "

Saguaro National Park receives far less traffic than most other parks, so there was no gate, and we nearly missed the sign that said we entered the park.

        description: "The Mammoth Lake trip was probably one of the most adventure-packed trips of my life.  Mark and I made the trip for the long 4th of July weekend with plans to cram as much as possible into the weekend.  I don’t think we could have done much more.  Every day we hiked, climbed, kayaked, swam, and mountain biked.   We set base camp at Lake Mary with an elevation of 8,967 feet.  Each day we travelled up 1,000 feet to nearby bouldering hubs or down 1,000 feet on a bike trip.  Fortunately, the free bike shuttle helped us get back up after a ride down.  On the day we departed, I was determined to reach a summit in the area.  Mammoth Mountain provided a beautiful and challenging 5.5-mile hike up 2,500 feet of elevation gain with views of all 10 major lakes in the area.  This weekend was not your standard relaxing vacation from work, but rather a trial of determination to maximize fun."

This was really the start of about six months of fun exploring all around Southern California and Arizona.  "
