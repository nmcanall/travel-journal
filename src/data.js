I was looking at the trip between my last stop at the Colorado River and the next stop in Sedona, AZ and was pretty disappointed.  Without much time until meeting Mark in Sedona, I wanted something quick and epic.  After some time staring at a map, Hualapai Peak jumped out.  My van struggled as I climbed the mountain on the approach the trailhead.  Turns out, the area was closed for the winter, but that sign really just looked like it applied to carsâ€¦ so off I went.  The trail was snow packed and there was no one around for miles.  I started the steep climb to the peak, but with only a few hours, about 8 miles, and several thousand feet to climb in the snow, I ended up making it to a separate peak (unmarked on Google Maps) named Aspen Peak.  Total trip about 5 miles, 1,500 feet of elevation gain, and a fast jog to the bottom to make some time.  While I may not have reached the summit I wanted, it hit the goal of quick and epic."
